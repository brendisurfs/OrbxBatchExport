# Houdini ORBX Batch Exporter

## By Brendan Prednis

### Why?
I, among other Houdini users, have run into the issue of trying to export massive Houdini animations to ORBX, only to reach the limits of what a single ORBX file can handle for now. Being an incredibly useful file format for the Octane ecosystem, I wanted to make it as effortless as possible to send these massive scenes to the RNDR network to render.

### What can I do with the code? 
If you work in another DCC, such as Cinema4D or Blender, I would be thrilled if you used this code to build the same feature for those applications. 
While I have used both programs mentioned, I spend 99% of my 3D time in Houdini. 
I believe it would be better for someone with an understanding of the certain caveats and behaviors of their main program to port this.
All I ask is that you give credit to me and link this Github, and of course share your creation with me if you build off of it! 

### What if I find a bug/issue?
Please file an issue on Github with your Houdini version, OS, Octane version, and a desccription of what you are trying to make happen vs. what is actually happening. 
It is innevitable that issues may arise with so many different systems and setups, and I will try to find the issue as best as I can. 
I welcome the Houdini programming community to help as well if they run into an issue.
